"Search the Web Together"

Snipdex is a peer-to-peer protocol for large-scale distributed
Internet search. Snipdex enables you to find what you are looking
for quickly by leveraging the resources of other machines connected
to the snipdex network. Welcome! Now, let's search the web together.

To provide access to your own collection of documents you can run
the Snipdex Server (service) and indicate which documents you want
to share with the rest of the world. Snipdex will then enable others
to find the stuff you want to share.

If you only want to search the Internet with Snipdex, that's fine too!
You still need to run the Snipdex Server, but you need not indicate
any documents too share. The Snipdex Server will only participate in 
the peer-to-peer network to speed up global searching for you and 
others. To search the Internet you only need to start the Snipdex 
Client and type your query, it is as simple as that.

If you do not want to install any software on your machine, and prefer
a web interface, surf to our homepage http://snipdex.org and search the
web from there (in some future, better world).
